â€‹# Enchantment MMO

Mood of the game: a dark world with evil magic and demons. Greed is the creed, each player for himself.

Players can summon demons they need to slay in order to gain treasures. Players can also steal treasures from each other.

Every player can discover a new part of the world.

Each world area is first automatically generated when it is discovered, then players can modify the world with enslaved demons and materials gained in treasures.

Players don't fight each other directly: they can lay traps or summon demons within a certain distance.

At the start, each player starts with a few basic spells. Gaining new spells is part of the aims of the game.

Another aim is to is to expand one's domain and take control of other players domains.

The game is challenging and dangerous.

Battles are mostly magical but demons can inflict physical damage if they get within melee range of the character (not advisable to ever let that happen).

Demons are always aggressive to all and attack on sight.


## Skills

Player create only one character and spread points in these skills:

* Summoning: 1 to 7 (actual max is 10)
* Magic: 1 to 7 (max is 10)
* Life: 1 to 7 (no max)

There is no leveling and the only way to improve a character are:

* to gain treasures by defeating demons or
* stealing treasures stored somewhere by other players or
* stealing from the corpse of a player that hasn't come back fast enough to get the treasures left where he died.

### Summoning

How likely is the summoning to be succesful and how powerful the demon is. All demons are aggressive, but they can be summoned far enough that they don't attack the summoner. Different demons have various agro range. The power of the demon is determined by the summoning score. The quality of his treasures, if defeated, gets better the more powerful the demon is. At character creation the summoning skill can't be higher than 7, the absolute maximum being 10.

### Magic

Strength of the non-summoning spells cast by the character. Ability to resist magical attacks. This is a percentage, therefore a skill of 10 means the character has a 100% chance of resisting magical attacks. At creation, the maximum is 7, or a 70% chance of resisting magical attacks.

### Life

There is not maximum for life, but at character creation it can't be higher than 7. Each life point counts. Both physical and magical attacks will inflict damage on a character. When life hits 0, the character loses everything he is carrying and should do a corpse run to regain everything.

Casting a spell doesn't use mana: it uses Life points, either from the character himself or from a sacrificial victim (human preferably, but animals will do).

Life doesn't regenerate by itself over time. It has to be taken from someone or something alive through a sacrifice ritual. A quick murder generate a small amount of Life for the character, whereas more elaborate rituals that involve time and pain will generate much more Life points.
